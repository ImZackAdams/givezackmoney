        <p>Meet Zack, the self-proclaimed "most average" web developer in the world. Born in the small town of Pixelville, Zack discovered his passion for web development when he accidentally opened the 'Inspect Element' tool in his browser. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
        <p>Zack has an impressive portfolio of one whole website - this one! Despite having no formal training, no awards, and zero design sense, Zack believes that his enthusiasm and knack for using neon colors make up for it. He's on a mission to get better, one donation at a time.</p>
        <p>When he's not busy breaking websites, Zack enjoys collecting rubber ducks, practicing the kazoo, and participating in competitive potato peeling. He's also a three-time champion of the "Worst Website of the Year" award, an honor he holds close to his heart.</p>
        <p>Zack's life motto? "If it ain't broke... it's probably because I haven't touched it yet."</p>
